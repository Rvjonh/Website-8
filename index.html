            <h2>Who Needs the Most Financial IQ?</h2>
            <p>For those who may not have read my second book in the Rich Dad series, Rich Dad’s CASHFLOW Quadrant, I will briefly explain. The CASHFLOW Quadrant is about the four different groups of people who make up the world of money.</p>

            <p>For people whose career path is in the E quadrant, they may not think they need much financial intelligence. The same is true for those in the S quadrant.</p>
            <p>My poor dad, as a schoolteacher in the E quadrant for most of his life, did not place much value on financial intelligence. That is until he lost his job and entered the world of business. In less than a year, his savings and retirement were gone. If not for Social Security and Medicare, he would have been in serious financial trouble.</p>
            <p>My mom, being a nurse, wanted me to become a doctor. She knew I wanted to be rich, and the richest people she knew were doctors. She wanted me to stake my claim in the S quadrant. Obviously, those were the days before malpractice insurance costs went through the roof. Again, being a nurse, she did not see much need for financial intelligence. Her solution for me was to simply get a high-paying job. As you know, there are many people with high-paying jobs who have no money.</p>
            <p>If you want to be an entrepreneur who builds a B quadrant business, or a professional investor in the I quadrant, financial intelligence is everything. For those in the B and I quadrants, financial intelligence is essential because it’s the intelligence that gets you paid. In the B and I quadrants, the higher your financial intelligence is, the higher your income will be.</p>
            <p>Rich dad said to me, “You can be a successful doctor and be poor. You can also be a successful schoolteacher and be poor. But you cannot be a successful entrepreneur or investor and be poor. Success in the B and I quadrants is measured in money. That is why financial intelligence is so important.”</p>
